#Match the Color!

You're given a random color, and buttons that control the amount of red, green, and blue values of the background color.  As soon as you match the background with the given color, you can reset with a new color and try again.  Great for learning how colors work.  In the harder modes, alpha comes into play as well.

There's a zen mode for those who want to just play around with colors.
